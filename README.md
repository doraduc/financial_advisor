Financial Advisor Game - My Python Project
What This Is
I made a simple Python game where you pretend to be a financial advisor. You get 3 fake clients and give them money advice.

What It Does
Shows info about 3 different people

Tells them how to invest their money

Gives different advice based on age

The Clients
Ivan - 25 years old, doesn't have much saved, wants to buy a car

Maria - 45 years old, has some savings, thinking about retirement

Alexey - 60 years old, has good savings, wants to keep money safe

How to Run
Save the file as financial_advisor.py

Open terminal

Type: financial_advisor.py

Follow the menu

What I Learned
How to use Python dictionaries

How to make functions

Basic investment ideas (young = more risk, old = less risk)

Why I Made This
I'm learning Python and wanted to make something with finance since I want to work in quant finance someday.

It's Not Perfect
This is just a student project. The advice is simple. Real financial advisors know way more.

Code Is Simple
I tried to keep the code easy to read. No fancy stuff, just basic Python.
